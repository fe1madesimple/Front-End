    <p class="text-dark-200">
      The court held that the advertisement constituted a unilateral offer to
      the world at large, which was accepted by Mrs. Carlill through
      performance. The company's deposit of £1,000 showed clear intention to be
      bound.

      <p>
        When discussing offer and acceptance, mention Carlill to illustrate
        unilateral contracts and the principle that performance can constitute
        acceptance.
